## Tech Stack

This project uses:
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Package Manager**: npm

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v14 or higher)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- A REST API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) (VS Code extension)

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Code Duel Backend repository](https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Code_duel_backend)
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Code_duel_backend.git
cd Code_duel_backend
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### Step 3: Add Upstream Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Code_duel_backend.git
```

Verify the remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:
- `origin` - your fork (`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Code_duel_backend.git`)
- `upstream` - the original repository (`https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Code_duel_backend.git`)

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and fill in your values. Contact organizers for shared credentials (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables--secrets) section above).

```env
# Example .env structure
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/code_duel_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
NODE_ENV=development
```

> **Never commit your `.env` file.** It is already listed in `.gitignore`.

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 6: Set Up the Database

```bash
# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# (Optional) Seed the database with initial data
npm run seed
```

### Step 7: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever port is in your `.env`).

Verify it's working:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Expected: { "status": "ok" }
```

### Step 8: Create a New Branch

**IMPORTANT**: Always create a new branch for your work. Never work directly on the `main` branch.

```bash
# First, sync your fork with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - for new features (e.g., `feature/add-auth-endpoint`)
- `fix/` - for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/user-query-error`)
- `docs/` - for documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-api-readme`)
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/optimize-db-queries`)
- `chore/` - for maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Pick an Issue

- Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Code_duel_backend/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled:
  - `good-first-issue` or `beginner` - for beginners (Level 1)
  - `intermediate` - for intermediate level (Level 2)
- **Comment on the issue** with your request and team number, e.g.:
  > *"Hi, I'd like to work on this issue. - Team 07"*
- **Wait to be officially assigned** - do not start writing any code until a maintainer assigns you
- **Do not work on an issue already assigned to someone else**

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Test all your API endpoints using Postman or Thunder Client
- Ensure the server runs without errors or warnings

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Run tests (if applicable)
npm run test

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint
```

Always test your endpoints manually before submitting a PR:
- ✅ Success cases (200, 201)
- ✅ Error cases (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty input, invalid data, missing fields)

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication endpoint"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` - new feature (e.g., `feat: add password reset endpoint`)
- `fix:` - bug fix (e.g., `fix: handle null value in user query`)
- `docs:` - documentation (e.g., `docs: add API endpoint docs`)
- `refactor:` - code restructuring (e.g., `refactor: simplify auth middleware`)
- `test:` - adding tests (e.g., `test: add unit tests for user service`)
- `chore:` - maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore: update dependencies`)

**Examples of Good Commit Messages:**
```bash
feat: add POST /api/match endpoint with validation
fix: resolve 500 error on invalid JWT token
refactor: move database logic to service layer
docs: document match creation API in README
chore: add zod schema for request validation
```

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Code_duel_backend`
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** button
3. Fill out the PR template completely:
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive title (e.g., `feat: add match creation endpoint`)
   - **Team Number**: You **must** state your team number (e.g., `Team 07`) - PRs without this will be closed
   - **Issue Reference**: Link the assigned issue (e.g., `Closes #42`) - PRs without a linked issue will be closed unless it's a general improvement PR
   - **Description**: Explain what endpoint/logic you added or changed and why
   - **API Changes**: Document any new or modified endpoints (method, route, request body, response)
4. Click **"Create pull request"**

---

## Issue Guidelines

### Finding Issues

**Beginner Level (Good First Issues)**
- Adding input validation to existing routes

### How to Request an Issue

1. Find an unassigned issue you want to work on
2. **Comment on the issue** with this format:
   > *"I'd like to work on this. - Team [your team number]"*
3. **Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you** - this is mandatory
4. Once assigned, start working and submit your PR within **3–5 days**
5. If you can't complete it in time, comment to let maintainers know

> Before opening a new issue, ensure:
> - The issue does not already exist
> - It is clearly documented
> - It aligns with the project scope

### Creating a New Issue

When creating a new issue:

1. Use a clear and descriptive title
2. Add a detailed description:
   - What is the problem?
   - Steps to reproduce (if bug)
   - Expected behavior
   - Screenshots (if UI-related)
3. Wait for maintainer review before starting work

## Pull Request Process

### PR Requirements - Non-Negotiable

> PRs that don't meet ALL of the following will be **closed without review**:

- [ ] **Team number stated** in the PR description (e.g., `Team XX`)
- [ ] **Linked to your assigned issue** via `Closes #issue-number`
- [ ] **You are the assigned contributor** for that issue
- [ ] PR is raised **after** assignment, not before

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code runs without errors (`npm run dev` works)
- [ ] Project builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All new components are properly typed (TypeScript)
- [ ] Tailwind CSS classes used - no inline styles
- [ ] Tested on different screen sizes
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Commit messages follow the conventional format

### PR Review Process

1. A maintainer will review your PR within 24–48 hours
2. You may be asked to make changes - respond promptly
3. Make requested changes and push to the same branch (PR auto-updates)
4. **Only maintainers can approve and merge** - do not request peers to merge

### Addressing Review Comments

```bash
# Make the requested changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review comments"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with beginner issues to understand the codebase
2. **Read Existing Code**: Look at how similar features are implemented
3. **Always use pnpm**: Never switch to npm or yarn mid-project
4. **Ask Questions**: It's better to ask than to waste time going in the wrong direction
5. **Be Patient**: Code review takes time, be responsive to feedback
6. **Have Fun**: Open source is about learning and community!
